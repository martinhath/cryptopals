#Crypto library

This is the repo for a crypto related library in C I'm working on.
The stuff in here is mainly created for the [Matasano Crypto Challenge](http://cryptopals.com/),
so it's not by far an actual crypto library.

The code is partly in `C89`, and partly in `C99` (considering where 
variables are declared), so read and weep.
